CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS,

TO  USE OF  OR INABILITY TO  USE THE  BINARY  CODEC  OR  LICENSED TECHNOLOGY, OR

BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.  THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL 
NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM NEGLIGENCE 
SOLELY TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION.

from and against any claims, damages, losses, costs, expenses or lawsuits (including reasonable 
attorneys’ fees) of any third party:

8.2.1. that arise out of, or result from, or relate to this Agreement, actions of Licensee's independent 
contractor or service provider in connection with Internal Development or Internal Use, or a Licensee 
Product; and 
 
8.2.2. which are not attributable solely to Avid’s activities, and would therefore be capable of assertion 
against Avid even absent Licensee’s activities. 
 
9. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION 
 
9.1. Limited Use and Nondisclosure of Avid Confidential Information. The Avid Confidential 
Information shall be used by Licensee solely for the purposes permitted under this Agreement.  
Licensee agrees that it will not disclose or permit use of any part of the Avid Confidential Information to 
or by any third party, other than (a) its employees who are both directly participating in work under this 
Agreement and contractually bound to protect the confidentiality of the Avid Confidential Information, 
or (b) its accountants or lawyers.  Licensee will use the same measures that it uses to protect its own 
confidential information, and no less than reasonable measures, to prevent any disclosure or misuse 
of any part of the Avid Confidential Information.  Except as expressly permitted otherwise in this 
Agreement, Licensee shall not reverse engineer, decompile, analyze, copy, modify, transcribe, lease 
or otherwise transfer or distribute any part of the Avid Confidential Information, or use any part of the 
Avid Confidential Information to design, develop, improve or enhance any product.  This Section 9.1 
shall not be construed as granting any rights in the Avid Confidential Information except those 
expressly stated in Section 2. 
 
9.2. Irreparable Harm.  Licensee acknowledges and agrees that the restrictions contained in 
Section 9 are necessary for the protection of Avid Confidential Information, and considers them to be 
reasonable for such purpose.  Licensee agrees that any breach of these restrictions may cause Avid 
substantial and irreparable damage and therefore, in the event of any such breach, Licensee agrees 
that Avid shall be entitled to specific performance and other injunctive relief, in addition to such other 
remedies as may be afforded by applicable law, without posting a bond. 
 
10. TERM AND TERMINATION 
 
10.1. Term.  This Agreement has an initial term of three (3) years from the Effective Date, unless 
terminated  earlier  under  one  of  Sections  10.2  or  10.3.   This Agreement  will  automatically  renew 
thereafter for additional one (1) year terms upon notice of renewal by Avid to the Licensee, unless 
renewal is declined by Licensee within thirty (30) days of the notice of renewal, or unless terminated 
earlier under one of Sections 10.2 or 10.3.  Renewal may be conditioned upon compliance with any 
reasonable amendments or changes to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as set forth in such 
notice. 
 
10.2. Termination for Cause.  This Agreement shall terminate: 
 
10.2.1. immediately, if Licensee is in breach of its confidentiality obligations under Section 9; or

remedy such breach within thirty (30) days after receipt of notice of such breach from Avid. 
 
10.3. Change of Control or Insolvency.  Licensee shall notify Avid of any change in membership, 
change in ownership, or other change of control of Licensee.  In the event of such a change which, in 
Avid’s sole, reasonable judgment, substantially affects control of Licensee, Avid may terminate this 
Agreement, effective thirty (30) days after written notice of the Licensee. Avid also may terminate this 
Agreement, immediately and without notice, if Licensee should (1) admit in writing its inability to pay its 
debts generally as they become due; (2) make a general assignment for the benefit of creditors; (3) DocuSign Envelope ID: 1A531662-5531-4BBF-8D31-F8C94B3D7158

10.6, and 11 and Schedule A expressly survive termination of this Agreement.  Upon termination of this 
Agreement or expiration of the sixty day period in this Section 10.4, Licensee must otherwise destroy

10.5. No Liability for Termination.  Neither Party is liable to the other for damages of any sort resulting 
solely from terminating this Agreement in accordance with its terms. 
 
10.6. End Users.  Termination of this Agreement will not terminate or affect any sublicenses granted 
to End Users in accordance with this Agreement.

11.3. Choice of Law, Jurisdiction and Venue.  This Agreement shall be governed by the laws in force 
in the United States and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts excluding its conflicts of law rules,

the law of the country in which the patent right has been granted.  For disputes arising under this

that they have each insisted that this Agreement and any related documents be drawn up in the 
English language.) 
 
11.5. No Partnership or Joint Venture.  This Agreement shall not create a principal-agent relationship 
between Avid and Licensee, nor shall anything herein be construed to cause the Parties to be acting as 
partners or as a joint venture.  Neither Party shall have any power or authority to obligate or bind the 
other Party in any manner and neither Party shall make any representation or warranty on behalf of the 
other Party. 
 
11.6. Force Majeure. Neither Party shall be liable for any delay or failure in the performance of any 
obligation under this Agreement, except for payment obligations, if such delay or failure is due to causes 
beyond its reasonable control, such as natural catastrophes, war or civil disturbances, governmental 
demands, acts or omissions, labor strikes, or transportation stoppages. 
 
11.7. Severability.  If any provision in this Agreement is held to be unenforceable for any reason, then 
such provisions shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable, and such decision 
shall not affect the enforceability of such provision under other circumstances or in other jurisdictions 
and shall not affect the enforceability of any remaining provision of this Agreement; provided, however, 
that no such reformation shall be effective if it materially changes the economic benefit of this Agreement 
to, or the proprietary interests of, either Party. 
 
11.8. Captions.  The captions to the Sections of this Agreement are for convenience only, and are 
not a part of this Agreement, and shall not be deemed to have any effect in construing this Agreement. 
 
11.9. No Waiver.  None of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been waived by 
any act or acquiescence by a Party, its agents or employees, but only by an instrument in writing 
signed by a duly authorized signatory of the Party.

assigned or transferred by either Party without consent of the other Party, which consent will not be 
unreasonably withheld. 
 
11.11.  Representation of Counsel.  Each Party has had the opportunity to be represented by counsel 
of its choice in negotiating this Agreement.  This Agreement shall therefore be deemed to have been 
negotiated at arm’s length, with the advice and participation of counsel, and prepared at the joint request, 
direction and instruction of the Parties, and shall be interpreted in accordance with its terms without 
favor to any Party. DocuSign Envelope ID: 1A531662-5531-4BBF-8D31-F8C94B3D7158

Royalty Period.  Sales shall be considered to have occurred when shipped from the Licensee or its 
distributor to an end user or third party manufacturer or, in the case of shared services, which such 
service was provided.  The written statement shall identify, as applicable: the products Sold for use by

the Royalty Period, the total duration in months of all Subscriptions of Licensee Products sold on a 
subscription basis in the Royalty Period, the minutes and partial minutes of video essence encoded or 
decoded  by  Licensee’s  service,  the  Applicable  Royalty  Rate  for  each  product,  the  country  of 
manufacture for the product, the country of sale for the product or service, the total royalty due for each 
product or service, and the total royalty due. For each sale by Licensee as an OEM to a third party 
manufacturer,  Licensee may  omit the  number  of  units  Sold,  but shall  include  the  name,  principal 
business address, and contact information (including a responsible person or office, and email address) 
of the third party manufacturer to which units were Sold. Licensee’s principal financial officer, or a person 
acting  under  the  duly  delegated  authority  of  Licensee’s  principal  financial  officer,  shall  certify  the 
correctness of the statement.  The statement for each Royalty Period shall be delivered to Avid within 
thirty (30) days following the end of that Royalty Period, along with payment for that Royalty Period.  Any 
taxes assessed by any governments, including any of its departments or subdivisions, shall be for the 
account of Licensee.  All payments made hereunder are non-refundable. 
 
A.3.2.  Records and Auditing.  Licensee shall keep complete and accurate records of its activities under 
this Agreement.  Not more than once each year, Avid may appoint a Certified Public Accountant, or 
equivalent thereof, of Avid’s choice for the purpose of performing an audit of Licensee’s relevant records.  
If, upon audit of Licensee’s records, it is determined that Licensee has underpaid by five percent (5%) 
or more the payment due to Avid for any period, Licensee shall promptly reimburse Avid for the full 
reasonable cost of the audit and pay to Avid the deficiency in the payment due Avid, including the interest 
prescribed in Section A.3.4. 
 
A.3.3.  Currency.  Payments by Licensee shall be made in United States dollars either directly to Avid 
or to such banks as Avid may designate in writing to Licensee.  If applicable, conversions from local 
currency to U.S. dollars shall be at the most favorable rate of exchange on the date payment is due, or 
when payment is made, whichever is earlier. 
 
A.3.4.  Interest Rate.  If a payment due under this Agreement is late, interest at the lower of the rate of 
ten percent (10%) per annum and the maximum rate permitted by law, assessed as from the last day of 
the first month following each period, shall be due from Licensee without special notice.  Such a late 
payment is still a breach and this assessment of or payment of interest neither forgives nor cures such 
a breach.

Schedule B 
Avid DNxHD® MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT 
 1. BACKGROUND 
Licensee,  by  selecting  the  Maintenance  option  on  the  Summary  of  the Agreement  to  which  this 
Maintenance Agreement is attached as Schedule B, seeks to purchase certain maintenance services 
related to the Licensed Avid DNxHD Technology.  Avid is willing to provide maintenance services to 
Licensee  for  the  Licensed Avid  DNxHD  Technology,  subject  to  the  terms  and  conditions  of  this 
Maintenance Agreement. To the extent that any terms or conditions of this Maintenance Agreement 
conflict with those of the Agreement between Avid and Licensee to which this Maintenance Agreement 
is attached as Schedule B, the terms of the Agreement supersedes the terms herein. 
 
 2. DEFINITIONS 
This  Maintenance Agreement  shall  constitute  a  related  agreement  to  the Agreement.    Except  as 
otherwise  defined  herein,  capitalized  terms  used  in  this  Maintenance Agreement  shall  have  the 
meanings ascribed to them in the Agreement. 
 
 3. MAINTENANCE 
 3.1. Payment.  Licensee agrees to pay Avid fifteen hundred dollars ($1500.00) in Maintenance 
Fees for twelve (12) months of Maintenance Services related to the Avid DNxHD Software. Promptly 
after execution of this Maintenance Agreement, Avid will issue an invoice to Licensee for the amount 
due.  The invoice shall be due and payable within thirty (30) days of the invoice date. If Licensee 
discontinues and then resumes purchase of Maintenance Services, Licensee will be required to pay 
Avid the entire Maintenance Fees for the period of discontinuance, plus Maintenance Fees for the 
term of the Maintenance Services then commencing. A monthly interest charge at the rate of one and 
one-half percent (1 1/2%) or the maximum legal rate, if maximum legal rate is less than one and one-
half percent (1 1/2%), will be assessed on all payments more than five (5) days past due.  Licensee's 
obligation to pay the amounts due or to become due hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional 
and shall not be subject to any reduction, setoff, defense, counterclaim, or deferment for any reason 
whatsoever.  If the Licensee fails to make any payment to Avid under this Maintenance Agreement or 
any related agreement within fifteen (15) days of its due date, Avid may terminate this Maintenance 
Agreement by giving written notice of termination to Licensee or refuse to provide maintenance until 
Licensee’s account is in good standing. 
 3.2. Renewal. This Maintenance Agreement shall automatically renew for successive Maintenance 
Services Terms of twelve (12) months each, unless and until either party elects to terminate this 
Maintenance Agreement upon expiration of the Term (either initial or renewal) then in effect by giving 
written notice of its intention to the other Party at least thirty (30) days prior to the date of such expiration. 
In order to continue Maintenance Services following the end of an annual Maintenance Services Term, 
Licensee must pay the Maintenance Fees set by Avid for that subsequent Term within thirty (30) days 
following the start of a successive Term. Before the end of the eleventh (11th) month of each twelve (12) 
month Maintenance Services Term, Avid may adjust the annual Maintenance Fees for the successive 
Term by providing written notice to Licensee. 
 3.3. Maintenance  Services.    During  the Term  of  this  Maintenance Agreement, Avid  will  provide 
Licensee Access to Maintenance Releases and Minor Releases related to the Licensed Avid DNxHD 
Technology that Avid makes generally available to all Licensees during the Maintenance Services Term, 
at no additional charge.  “Maintenance Releases” for software technology are represented by a change 
in the portion of the version number to the right of the second decimal point. “Minor Releases” are DocuSign Envelope ID: 1A531662-5531-4BBF-8D31-F8C94B3D7158

Avid Trademark Usage Guidelines 
Avid’s trademarks and the associated goodwill are valuable assets, and the proper use of these 
trademarks is very important to Avid.  You may use Avid’s trademarks to identify Avid products, services 
and promotions, provided that you comply with these guidelines (and, if you have an agreement with 
Avid, any other applicable terms contained in your agreement).  
    
You may use Avid trademarks (but not logos, taglines or icons) to identify Avid products or services, 
provided that such references are truthful and fair, and are not misleading as to Avid sponsorship of or 
affiliation with you or your company, or endorsement of your products or services.  You may use Avid DocuSign Envelope ID: 1A531662-5531-4BBF-8D31-F8C94B3D7158

trademarks with referential phrases such as “for use with,” “for,” “works with” or “compatible with,” as 
long as you do not suggest that Avid is the source of your product or that Avid endorses it.    
  
When using Avid trademarks, the Avid trademark should be in text no larger than the surrounding text, 
and your trademarks should be more prominent than the Avid trademarks.    
  
An Avid trademark should not be combined with any trademark, business name, or product or service 
name of another company.  The Avid trademark may not be used in a manner that might create 
potential confusion as to the source of your products or services, or ownership of the Avid trademark.  
The Avid trademark may not be used in connection with anything disparaging of Avid, or its products, 
services, or employees.  Avid trademarks should be used as adjectives with a generic term for the 
product or service (e.g., the Media Composer® software), and not as nouns or verbs.  They should not 
be used in the plural or in the possessive.  Do not shorten or abbreviate an Avid trademark.   
  
Logos  
  
Neither the Avid logo nor the other logos of Avid Technology may be used without the express prior 
written approval of Avid Technology.  If such approval is granted, logos may be reproduced only from 
electronic files provided by Avid, without any modification.  The size of the logo may be scaled, but the 
proportions and integrity of all elements of the logo must be maintained.  A minimum amount of empty 
space must be left between the logo and any other object such as type, photography, borders, edges, 
etc.  The required border of empty space must be equal to or greater than 50% of the height of the 
logo.  
  
Trademark Notice  
  
Avid maintains a list of its trademarks on its website.  This list also states whether the ® symbol or the 
™ symbol should be used in connection with the Avid trademark.  In addition, when you use an Avid 
trademark, you should include the following attribution notice with your other trademark or copyright 
notices: “[Avid Trademark] is a trademark or registered trademark of Avid Technology, Inc. or its 
subsidiaries in the United States and/or other countries.”  
  
These guidelines may be updated from time to time, and Avid may provide additional guidelines for 
specific trademarks.  The current version of these guidelines is always available at www.avid.com
