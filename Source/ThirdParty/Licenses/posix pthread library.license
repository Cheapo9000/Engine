License Change
--------------
With the agreement of all substantial relevant contributors Pthreads4w
version 3, with the exception of four files, is being released under the
terms of the Apache License v2.0. The APLv2 is compatible with the GPLv3
and LGPLv3 licenses and therefore this code may continue to be legally
included within GPLv3 and LGPLv3 projects.

A substantial relevant contributor was defined as one who has contributed
original code that implements a capability present in the releases going
forward. This excludes several contributors who have contributed code
that has been obsoleted, or have provided patches that fix bugs,
reorganise code for aesthetic or practical purposes, or improve build
processes. This distinction was necessary in order to move forward in the
likelyhood that not all contributors would be contactable. All
contributors are listed in the file CONTRIBUTORS.

The four files that will remain LGPL but change to v3 are files used to
configure the GNU environment builds:

	aclocal.m4
	configure.ac
	GNUmakefile.in
	tests/GNUmakefile.in

Contributors who have either requested this change or agreed to it when
consulted are:

John Bossom
Alexander Terekhov
Vladimir Kliatchko
Ross Johnson

Pthreads4w version 2 releases will remain LGPL but version 2.11 and later
will be released under v3 of that license so that any additions to
pthreads4w version 3 code that is backported to v2 will not pollute that
code.
